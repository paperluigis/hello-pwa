# Hello PWA
The classic Hello World program as a Progressive Web App

## What It Is

A simple PWA demo that displays the text "Hello, World!" utilizing an app manifest, service workers and caching. This demo is written in plain-vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript (ES6). It has no dependencies.

I've also written a tutorial to go along with the code. Read it on Medium:
